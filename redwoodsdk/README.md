# RedwoodSDK Minimal Starter

This is the starter project for RedwoodSDK. It's a template designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

Create your new project:

```shell
npx create-rwsdk my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

## Running the dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

Point your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`). You should see a "Hello World" message in your browser.
